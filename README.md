# highest-profit-challenge

Thank you for the opportunity to attempt this challenge. Admittedly, I have not written code from scratch in Java in about 2 years so my knowledge was extremely limited and I am in great need of refresher courses since lately my coding tasks have been for data analysis in MATLAB or just modifying a line here or there in Java for scripts written for mechanical testing purposes.

I compiled the code the best I could for Part 1 and left commented descriptions of how I would have completed Part 2 had I been able to remember the necessary functions/code to do so.

This challenge truly reminded me of my interest in coding and inspired me to enroll in an extensive 3-week coding course so I could regain skills and learn new ones as well. Thank you!
