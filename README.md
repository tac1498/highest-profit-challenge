# highest-profit-challenge

Thank you for the opportunity to attempt this challenge. Admittedly, I have not written code in Java in about 2 years so my knowledge was extremely limited and I am in great need of refresher courses. 

I compiled the code the best I could for Part 1 and left commented descriptions of how I would have completed Part 2 had I been able to remember the necessary functions/code to do so.

This challange truly reminded me of my interest in coding and inspired me to enroll in an extensive 3-week coding course so I could regain the skills and learn new ones as well. Thank you!
